# UAS_Camera_Calculator
Repository of a shiny app to calculate various parameters in drone applications.

The specs of some drones are in the .csv file, which is read by the shiny app.
In the app, the user can set parameters, AOIs and upload their own DTM or download a DTM (SRTM).
From this, the Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) is calculated and visualized in multiple ways.
A raster of the GSD can then be exported for future reference.
